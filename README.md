The project is a simple music web application of the music that I listen to while working out at the gym. The idea of the project was mainly prompted by the continuous shuffling of my playlist on other platforms while working out, thus I always have to reach out to my phone and change the music I am listening to. I also decided to go for this project as it will enable me to test my understanding of the backend system (JavaScript) when incorporating the downloaded music and CSS for the platform interface. I am looking forward to transforming it into a downloadable application/apk after adding several songs. My biggest fear however, is licensing and the permissions from artists if the the platform gets to mainstream media.
Architecture & Technologies
The architecture of GymTunes consists of both front-end and back-end components. 
On the front-end, I used HTML for structuring the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as music playback and track switching. 
I also utilized a front-end framework like React.js for improved performance and modularity.
